<h1>About This Project</h1>
<p>During this project, we created a website that displayed a job list of companies that are hiring Information Technology jobs. Users are able to view a list of different types of jobs ranging from low, medium, and high level experience. 
While viewing the jobs a description is given that explains what the job is and what all you need to be considered for the job. </p>

        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
        <p>While making the website, we used JQuery, Bootstrap 4, and Handlebars.js. s a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 
        Bootstrap 4 is framework that helps webpages be responsive for mobile sites and other applications. Handlebars.js. is a popular templating engine that is powerful, simple to use and has a large community. 
        It is based on the Mustache template language, but improves it in several important ways. 
        With Handlebars, you can separate the generation of HTML from the rest of your JavaScript and write cleaner code.</p>
        
        <h2>Reponsive Web Design Techniques</h2>
        <p>During the time in the course we learned the different types of ways to create a responsive web page. A media query is a way for a developer to write a CSS3 stylesheet and declare styles for all UI elements that are 
        conditional to the screen size, media type and other physical aspects of the screen.
        With media queries, different styles for the same markup by asking the browser about relevant factors, such as device width, device pixel density and device orientation.</p>
       
       <p>Fluid grid layout will be the screen size or user device. Regardless of what the device or screen size is, components in fluid designs are going to flow and adapt to the user environment.</p>
