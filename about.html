  <h2>Introduction<br>---------------------</h2>
  <p>During this project, we created a website that displayed a job list of companies that are hiring Information Technology jobs.
    Users are able to view a list of different types of jobs ranging from low, medium, and high level experience. While viewing the
    jobs a description is given that explains what the job is and what all you need to be considered for the job. The site is structured
    in such a way as to facilitate easy access to relevant pages and allows for job seekers to easily contact the job posters</p>
  <br>

  <h2>All-Star Team<br>---------------------</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Codi Sordelet</h4>
      <p>Managed template development and handlebars functionality. Facilitated team collaboration and storage using GitHub as a means to track and
        maintain site changes.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Ian Davis</h4>
      <p>Managed new listings page development and scripting. Headed up glyph implementation and assisted in GitHub management.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Zack Downing</h4>
      <p>Managed User Interface and page structure development. Implemented Bootstrap footer and navbar. Facilitated creation of "About This Project" page.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>DJ Brown</h4>
      <p>Lead JSON and content editor. Maintained site content and managed the implementation of listings to "listings" and "new listings" pages.</p>
    <br>

  <h3>Implemented Functionalities<br>---------------------</h3>
  <p>During the time in the course we learned the different types of ways to create a responsive web page. A media query is a way for a developer
    to write a CSS3 stylesheet and declare styles for all UI elements that are conditional to the screen size, media type and other physical
    aspects of the screen. With media queries, different styles for the same markup by asking the browser about relevant factors, such as device
    width, device pixel density and device orientation. Fluid grid layout will be the screen size or user device. Regardless of what the device
    or screen size is, components in fluid designs are going to flow and adapt to the user environment.</p>
  <br>

  <h3>Development and Programming Features<br>---------------------</h3>
  <p>While making the website, we used JQuery, Bootstrap 4, and Handlebars.js. s a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes
    things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works
    across a multitude of browsers. Bootstrap 4 is framework that helps webpages be responsive for mobile sites and other applications.
    Handlebars.js. is a popular templating engine that is powerful, simple to use and has a large community. It is based on the Mustache template
    language, but improves it in several important ways. With Handlebars, you can separate the generation of HTML from the rest of your JavaScript
    and write cleaner code.</p>
